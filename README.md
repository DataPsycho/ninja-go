# GO Learning Projects

This is my recent learning path on GO Programming Language. The code is part of the udemy course by Todd McLeoad but also mixed with my personal exploration of different features of Go.

## How to Explore

In the source file directory the code files are divided in to different level with each code file having a markdown readme.md file inside which explain all the topics for that level. The learning still in prorgress so more stuff will be added and code structure might change in future.
